## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Implement Hangman Game

#### Description
Build a Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Display the current progress using underscores for unknown letters (e.g., `_ _ _ _`)
- Accept letter guesses from the user via `input()`
- Track incorrect guesses remaining and display them to the player
- Update the word display after each correct guess
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display clear win/lose messages with the solution
- Allow the player to play multiple rounds if desired

### 🛠️ Add Game Features (Optional Challenge)

#### Description
Enhance your Hangman game with additional features to make it more engaging.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Prevent duplicate letter guesses (ignore already-guessed letters)
- Implement difficulty levels with different word lists (easy, medium, hard)
- Display ASCII art representing the hangman state based on incorrect guesses
- Track and display game statistics (wins, losses, accuracy)
